    <h3><b> Taj Mahal </b></h3>
  
    <p>
        The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal
        garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh.
        It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with 
        construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest 
        house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were 
        added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and 
        Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal.
        For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome
        builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the 
        Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
